# ansible_proj
this setup was carried out in my linux Machine. i used my Linux machine as a control node deployed a webserver and a DB server on via VMware workstaion player. 
this setup was done to understand the configuration management process with ansible.
[websevers]       #CentOS deployed on this server
 COserver-1
 [DBserver]       # Ubuntu OS deployed on this server
 UBserver-2
 
 Problem: i could installed packages on this servers despite sucessfuly pinging the servers.
